# Week 3 Advance Frontend

# Day 1
## created next js app without recommended settings/config. observing how things could potentially break.
    npx create-next-app@latest app
## Installing tailwind css manually (in app dir):
    npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss 
## Additionally created a postcss config file and added a tailwind import in /app/globals.css
    /app/postcss.config.mjs
    /app/styles/globals.css
## Compared the above approach with installing tailwindcss through the create-next-app configuration itself. both seemed to provide the same output.
